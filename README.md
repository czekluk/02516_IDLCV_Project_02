# 02516_IDLCV_Project_02

## Project Description

This project aims at implementing encoder-decoder CNNs and UNets for semantic image segmentation of medical images (skin lesion and retinal blood vessels). Additionally, differnt  performance metrics shall be implemented and an ablation study shall be conducted.

## Data

Two datasets are in focus for this project. They are both stored in the `/dtu/datasets1/02516` directory on the DTU HPC.

**PH2:** This dataset contains the images for the skin lesion task. In total there are XX training images, XX validation images and XX test images. All have ground truth masks.

**DRIVE:** This dataset contains the images for the retinal blood vessel task. In total there are XX training images, XX validation images and XX test images. All have ground truth masks.
